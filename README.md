#This is the only required information you have acces to at the moment:

>You're Chinese local
>Year: 1995 

Currently there is a war ongoing with America at first u didnt think much of it until they annouced to throw bombs. You assumed that they couldnt do much against your own country (China). But it didnt take long for the tables to turn entirely on you. Suddenly it felt like it was yesterday when it was quiet and peaceful, you were with your friends out, drinking and having fun. Then a loud BOOM destroyed that beautyfull daydream.
Scared of the unknown but its bound to happen, also a lot unforeseen chaos across the whole world,  will you be able to witness it alive? You’ll have to stand strong and not give up the hope that u have forged along a long journey of sweat, tears and blood. In the end will you be able to survive the war and be able to see your friends, family and feel freedom again? 
There is bound to be a lot of different choices that has to be made…

A few years later you arrived through countless of hardship through a variety of lands to arrive in the Netherlands. As you prayed that they would let u in and help you is what you hoped and thought about for a few months. 
For those who endured a harsh time, would be granted something like safety, right? After a few days, months of waiting for the procedure to finally end. The crushing judgement of the gouvernement. As exactly like your silence prayers. The gouvernement has accepted to finally let you stay and help you.

Finally after a few days, weeks, months or years time had definetly not been easy on u. You still managed to be in safety. Now there is a long road of knownledge that u have yet to unlock. Therefore start all over again in this brand new foreign land.
